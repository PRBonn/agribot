## Project mission

The mission of the project is to build an agricultural robot (AgriBot) from
scratch with the aim of serving as a data-recording platform in fields.
For further information about the design and purpose of the robot, please follow the [About the AgriBot Project page](https://github.com/PRBonn/Agribot/blob/master/doc/about.md)

---

## Getting Started
For easily bringing up the robot and recording data refer to [Easy bring up & Record Data](https://github.com/PRBonn/Agribot/blob/master/doc/recorddata.md) which provides step-by-step
instructions to run the robot.
