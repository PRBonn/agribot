## Project mission

The mission of the project is to build an agricultural robot (AgriBot) from
scratch with the aim of serving as a data-recording platform in fields.
For further information about the design and purpose of the robot, please follow the [About the AgriBot Project page](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/about.md)

---

## Getting Started
For easily bringing up the robot and recording data refer to [Easy bring up & Record Data](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/recorddata.md) which provides step-by-step
instructions to run the robot.

  	Instructions for running the robot and recording the sensor data to a bagfile.
- [AgriBot Software :](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/api.md)
	Details about different packages written for the platform like navigation, localization, base controller, etc.
- [Mechanical Design :](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/mec.md)
	Detail about how mechanical structure has been designed and improved during the project time.
- [Electrical  Design :](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/elec.md)
	Electrical schematics and descriptions about connections and wiring protocols used in the robot.
- [Debug:](https://github.com/PRBonn/agribot/blob/master/doc/debug.md)
